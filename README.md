## The plugin will soon be updated to support the latest K2 release - a big thanks to its original developer (@joomkit / Alan Sparkes) for giving us the green light to continue maintaining the plugin for the K2 community.

### IMPORTANT: The plugin is NOT CURRENTLY working with K2 v.2.9.0 or newer. Please expect an update by late Sep/early Oct 2019.

# K2 Notify

**K2 Notify** is a Joomla plugin that adds some simple and effective email notifications for K2.

Currently only tested with Joomla 2.5 and K2 v2.6.9. This not a global content subscription solution!

### Features
* Global email alerts to preset emails when a K2 item is submitted via frontend editing
* Specific email alerts for preset emails when content is submitted to specific K2 categories
* Send email notifications to single or multiple email addresses
* Includes comment notifcation (when using the K2 comment system)

It adds a configuration screen to K2 categories which enables you to specify who should receive an email when a submmission is made on a per K2 category basis. You can also override these settings in the main plugin settings to set site-wide global options.
